/**
 * Generates a fresh wa.me redirect for an appointment's WhatsApp confirmation.
 *
 * Why a redirect instead of putting the wa.me URL directly in the admin email:
 * Gmail's mobile app re-encodes URL params when opening links from inside the
 * email view, which corrupts 4-byte UTF-8 emojis (🌿 📋 etc.) and they arrive
 * in WhatsApp as `?`. By emailing a short ASCII URL that we 302-redirect
 * server-side, the wa.me URL is constructed at click time with fresh, clean
 * encoding — bypassing Gmail's URL handler entirely.
 *
 * Auth: not required. The appointment ID is a 25-char cuid (unguessable),
 * and the data shown is the same as the public /book/confirmed/[id] page.
 * No destructive action — we just generate a wa.me deep link.
